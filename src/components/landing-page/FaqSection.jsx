        <p>
          We recommend a minimum bankroll of around €500 to start the right way.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s better to save and begin properly than to start undercapitalized and in a rush.

        <p>
          Our strategy combines objective data, subjective tennis knowledge, and player momentum and form. Value is important to target, but first you need to be able to follow a clear strategy before spotting value in the market.
        </p>

        <p>
          We apply 8 confirmations before entering a market. We only bet when everything in our strategy aligns — not based on emotions or intuition.

          Yes, we exclusively focus on the ATP tennis market. Niche betting provides a stronger edge: deeper information, faster access to insights and more exploitable mistakes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bookmakers concentrate on big sports where the people are; we focus on niche markets where bookmakers make mistakes.

          No. You will receive a copy linked to my master model, and I am the one who maintains and updates it.
        </p>

        <p>
          This means your version is automatically updated as well. You will always have access to the latest data and the most important ATP metrics of the moment.

      <>
        <p>
          The betting space is full of hype, fake screenshots and people betting purely on what they see, without evaluating the prices and odds they receive.
        </p>
        We do it differently:
        <ul className="faq-list">


          <li>
            Full transparency (screen recordings, bookmaker switching, proof of withdrawals, real execution)
          </li>
          <li>
            One niche, one sport, one proven framework
          </li>
          <li>
            Real study cases, recorded live — not just claims
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We don’t just give bets — we show the entire process behind them.
        </p>


      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I need a specific bookmaker to follow your bets?',
    a: (
      <>
        <p>
          No, you don’t. Our betting opportunities are mainly on the ATP market and we target only high-liquidity lines that are available on 95% of bookmakers.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also help our members by recommending the bookmakers that consistently offer the best odds in our markets.
