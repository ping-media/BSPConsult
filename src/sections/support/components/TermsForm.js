          <Typography variant="h6" sx={{ color: 'primary.contrastText', textAlign: 'left', mt: 1 }}>
            SILVER PACKAGE: This subscription grants the Subscriber access to the premium zone for a
            period of twelve (12) months, starting from the completion of the subscription order
            process. The subscription will automatically renew each year from the date of purchase.

            Consequently, it is acknowledged that during the month of December each year, no
            predictions can be provided, given the absence of scheduled events during this period.
            The month of December is an integral part of this subscription, and the lack of
            predictions during this month shall not constitute grounds for extending or renewing the
            subscription beyond its original term.
