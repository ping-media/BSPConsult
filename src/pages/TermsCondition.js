              <span>3.4.</span> By purchasing a Subscription, membership or

              Pursuant to Article 16(m) of the EU Consumer Rights Directive (2011/83/EU) and the UK Consumer Contracts Regulations (2013), the right of withdrawal does not apply to digital content or services that are provided immediately after purchase. By completing the purchase, the Customer expressly acknowledges and agrees that the service begins immediately and waives any right of withdrawal or cancellation once the service has commenced, including in cases where additional digital content is delivered manually within the agreed timeframe.

            <p className="T-Answer">
              4.1. The price of a Subscription, membership or program depends on the program selected by the Customer. The Company offers the following programs:

            <p className="T-Heading">SILVER PROGRAM</p>
            <p className="T-Answer">
              This program grants the Customer access to specific parts of the Platform, including sports-related analyses and informational Content created and shared by The Company, for a period of twelve (12) months starting from the completion of the subscription order process.
              <br /><br />
              This program automatically renews annually from the date of purchase unless canceled in accordance with Article 9.
              <br /><br />
              It is expressly understood that this program is linked to the ATP Tennis Calendar season as published annually on the ATP website. Consequently, the Customer acknowledges that during the months of November and December, the number of scheduled events may be significantly reduced or nonexistent. As a result, analyses, predictions or other related Content may be limited or unavailable during these periods. November and December form part of the subscription term, and the reduced or absent availability of Content during these months shall not constitute grounds for extension, renewal, refund, or compensation, unless explicitly communicated otherwise by The Company.
            </p>

            <p className="T-Heading">ADVANCED PROGRAM</p>
            <p className="T-Answer">
              This program grants the Customer access to a broader range of parts of the Platform than the Silver Program, including additional analyses, educational Content, and tools made available by The Company, for a period of twelve (12) months from the completion of the ordering process.
              <br /><br />
              Unless expressly stated otherwise at the time of purchase, this program does not automatically renew and access will terminate at the end of the subscription period unless renewed by the Customer.
              <br /><br />
              This program is also linked to the ATP Tennis Calendar season, and the same limitations regarding the months of November and December apply as described above.

            <p className="T-Heading">GOLD PROGRAM</p>

              <br /><br />
              Unless expressly stated otherwise at the time of purchase, this program does not automatically renew and access will terminate at the end of the subscription period unless renewed by the Customer.
              <br /><br />
              This program is intrinsically linked to the ATP Tennis Calendar season. The Customer acknowledges that during the months of November and December, the number of scheduled events may be significantly reduced or nonexistent, and that analyses or predictions may therefore be limited or unavailable. November and December remain integral parts of the subscription term and shall not justify any extension, renewal, or compensation.
